# Hi, I'm Dominik 👋

I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer at [@FLYERALARM](https://www.flyeralarm.com) by day and a programming language tinkerer by night. I love to explore new programming languages and database systems and talking about Kotlin and Apache Kafka. 
Started learning how to implement a compiler on the JVM for my [Meow programming language 😼](https://github.com/domnikl/meow-lang) as well as building [schema-registry-gitops](https://github.com/domnikl/schema-registry-gitops), which is a GitOps tool for Confluent's Schema Registry.

Apart from that, I also love to implement [algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/domnikl/algorithms-and-data-structures) and slowly reaching 100% on the Kotlin and Java tracks on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting Kotlin projects if you need any help.

💬 Ask me about Apache Kafka and I can talk about it for hours on end 😁
